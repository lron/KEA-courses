## Fernet cipher

This is a very simple exercise to practice encrypting and decrypting using in this case Fernet cipher, which is a symmetric cipher, and the Python module [cryptography](https://cryptography.io).

1. Install the [cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/installation/) Python module using either PIP or your preferred IDE.
2. Prepare some file called *mytext.txt* with the contents that you wish. Weâ€™ll be encrypting it.
3. Download the files *fernetEncryption.py* and *fernetDecryption.py* and place the *mytext.txt* file within the same directory.
4. Have a look at the code and run each of the scripts: first encryption and then decryption. You should get the original file after decryption.
