# KEA-courses

This is a curated list of links to external resources for the [Security Engineering](./Security-Engineering/SE_resources.md) (_Softwaresikkerhed_) and the [Applied Cryptography](./Applied-Cryptography/crypto_resources.md) (_Anvendt Kryptografi_) courses at KEA, organized by topics.
Other links and internal resources are to be found in our room’s LMS, i.e. Fronter.

Most of the links are provided as a complement to what it’s being taught in class, for those who want to prepare the lectures beforehand and those who wish to explore further on the topics.

If you have any extra resources relevant to the topics covered in the course, don’t hesitate to share them with me and I’ll make sure to add them here.
