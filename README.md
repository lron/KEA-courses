# KEA-courses

This repository contains resources and exercises for the [Security Engineering](./Security-Engineering/SE_resources.md) (_Softwaresikkerhed_) and the [Applied Cryptography](./Applied-Cryptography/crypto_resources.md) (_Anvendt Kryptografi_) courses at KEA, including a curated list of links to external resources, organized by topics.
Other internal resources and course materials are to be found at KEA's LMS, i.e. Fronter.

Most of the links are provided as a complement to what it’s being taught in class, for those students who want to prepare the lectures beforehand and those who wish to explore further on the topics.

If you have any extra resources relevant to the topics covered in the courses, don’t hesitate to share them with me and I’ll make sure to add them here. You can of course also make a PR.
